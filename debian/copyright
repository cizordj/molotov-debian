Comment: Why this package is in the contrib area
 The reason this package is in this area is because it only does do one thing
 and that thing is to manage a Windows iso image and as everyone knows windows
 is not free and software that depends on non-free components should go to the
 contrib area of the debian. Even though molotov is free software it's pretty
 useless without a Windows image.
